            Me and my friends were going to paint on canvases and see who's was better so we followed a video to see how to do it. At first you have to blend in the colors blue and black. I did it good but i did not like it but my friends told me it looked perfect.I said " I dont like it it looks sloppy." but I left it like that because I would probably ruin it. My friends did it with me too.Now we have to paint trees. We have to paint the trees black because the picture is about a dark forest.I painted the trees.I was going to erase it but then it was too late the paint aldready dried up. "it's still good you dont have to change it." My friends said but then the paint water fell."ahh! it came on my canvas!" I said. " But it did come on a little it's not a lot." my friend said. Then i wiped it off with a dry tissue paper."Ok now let's move on!" Now we have to make bushes for the trees.I do the bushes then I do a person walking inside the forest."Im done!" we all say at the same time.Then we laugh.
